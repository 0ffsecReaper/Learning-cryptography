**The caesar1 is just the caesar of shifting of 3 alphabates
  The caesar2 is just the caesar of shifting of require no. of alphabates
  The caesar3 is just the caesar of shifting of 3 but in the caesar 2 crashing when we use more than 20 i think to correct that we have done that
  The caesar4 is just the caesar of shifting of more than 26 or 40 it get crash so we used math for moduling by the 26**
